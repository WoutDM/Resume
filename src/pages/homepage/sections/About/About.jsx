            I’m an enthusiastic person who is always eager to develop myself and take on new experiences.
            With a cheerful attitude and smooth communication skills, I adapt easily to different situations and people.
            I see feedback as an opportunity to grow and I’m always open to improving myself. This combination of enthusiasm,
            flexibility, and a strong willingness to learn makes me, I believe, a valuable asset to any team. <br/><br/>

            Besides programming, I enjoy staying active and social. I play indoor football (futsal) every week, go running
            regularly, and occasionally do workouts to keep moving. I also like meeting up with friends, whether it’s to
            watch football and support my favourite teams, Club Brugge and Barcelona, play games together, or just go out
            for a drink. I enjoy watching other sports as well, such as Formula 1, cycling, and esports. In the evenings,
            I love to wind down with a good film or series.
